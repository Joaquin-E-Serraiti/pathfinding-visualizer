**Pathfinding Visualizer** is a user-friendly GUI to visualize and test pathfinding algorithms. It includes built-in tools that let programmers easily integrate their own custom algorithms with minimal setup—no need to build a visualization system from scratch—just focus on writing your algorithm, and everything else is handled.

The GUI supports adjustable grid size, drawing of start/end points and obstacles, and speed control for algorithm visualization.

This project is desgined for experimentation and algorithm development.

## 1. Quick Start

To download and run the GUI locally, see [DOWNLOAD_AND_RUN.md](./DOWNLOAD_AND_RUN.md).

## 2. Algorithm Integration

You can integrate and visualize your own pathfinding algorithm in the GUI with minimal setup. After downloading the project:

- Navigate to `Scripts/pathfinding algorithms/`.
- Open `myAlgorithm.js` — a template is already set up for you.
- Write your algorithm following the instructions provided in [VISUALIZE_YOUR_ALGORITHM.md](./VISUALIZE_YOUR_ALGORITHM.md).
- When finished, go to line 53 of the `gui.js` file and change:

```js
if (grid.startAndEndSet === 0b11) {aStar()}
```

to

```js
if (grid.startAndEndSet === 0b11) {myAlgorithm()}
```


## 3. Features & GUI Usage

### Interactive Grid

- **Click and drag to draw the start and end nodes, as well as obstacles**.
- Obstacles appear in dark gray :black_large_square:, the start node is green :green_square:, and the end node is red :red_square:.
- Placement order: obstacles are drawn after the end node; the end node is drawn after the start node.
- To erase, click and drag over any drawn element.
- To reposition the start or end node, erase it first, then draw again—the placement order will be respected.

**Note:** The pathfinding algorithm won’t run unless both the start and end nodes are placed.

### Grid Size Slider

- **Move the slider to select the number of columns in the grid**, with the number of rows automatically calculated to maintain the grid’s aspect ratio.
- The slider ranges from 17 to 119 and only allows odd numbers, ensuring both columns and rows are always odd.
- The grid starts with 29 columns by default.

### Clear grid button

- Clears the grid by erasing all drawn elements.

### Play/Stop button

- **Press the play button (▶️) to run the pathfinding algorithm in the grid**. Once pressed, it turns into a stop button (⏹️).
- **Pressing stop halts the algorithm and resets the grid to its pre-run state**, removing explored nodes and the path found.

**Notes:**
- Changing the grid size or pressing the clear grid button will also stop the algorithm.
- If the start and end nodes are not placed, the algorithm won’t run even if the play button is pressed.

### Speed Control button

- Controls the speed of the visualization when running the algorithm.
- It toggles between three speeds, from slower to faster, each time you press it.
